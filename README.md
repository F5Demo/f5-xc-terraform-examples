# F5 Distributed Cloud Hybrid Security Architecture Deployments

## Overview

Example hybrid security deployments utilizing F5 Distributed Cloud WAAP in conjunction with the F5 product portfolio.

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites

* F5 Distributed Cloud Account (F5XC)
  * Create an F5XC API certificate following this [How To](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/how-to/user-mgmt/credentials)
* NGINX Plus with App Protect license ([trial](https://www.nginx.com/free-trial-request/) is ok)
* AWS Account - Due to the assets being created, free tier will not work.
  * The F5 BIG-IP AMI being used from the AWS Marketplace must be applied to your account
* Terraform Cloud Account
* GitHub Account

## Assets

* **xc:** F5 Distributed Cloud WAAP
* **nap:** NGINX Kubernetes Ingress Controller with NGINX App Protect WAF
* **bigip:** F5 BIG-IP Advanced WAF
* **infra:** AWS Infrastructure (VPC, IGW, etc.)
* **eks:** AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service
* **arcadia:** Arcadia Finance test web application and API
* **juiceshop:** OWASP Juice Shop test web application

## Tools

* **Cloud Provider:** AWS
* **IAC:** Terraform
* **IAC State:** Terraform Cloud
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## Terraform Cloud

* **Workspaces:** Create a workspace for each asset in the workflow chosen
  * xc-bigip: infra, bigip, juiceshop, and xc
  * xc-nap: infra, eks, nap, arcadia, xc
  * xc-nap-api: infra, eks, nap, arcadia, xc
  * xc-nap-bot: infra, eks, nap, arcadia, xc
  
* **Variable Set:** Create a Variable Set with the following values.
  * AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: Your AWS Access Key ID
  * AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Your AWS Secret Access Key
  * AWS_SESSION_TOKEN: Your AWS Session Token
  * NGINX_JWT: Your NGINX Java Web Token assocaited with your NGINX license. Set this to nignx-repo.jwt
  * VOLT_API_P12_FILE: Your F5XC API certificate. Set this to api.p12
  * VES_P12_PASSWORD: Set this to the password you supplied when creating your F5 XC API key.
  * ssh_key: Your ssh key for access to created BIG-IP and compute assets.

## GitHub

* **Fork and Clone Repo**

* **Actions Secrets:** Create the following GitHub Actions secrets in your forked repo
  *  NGINX_JWT: The base64 encoded NGINX Java Web Token assocaited with your NGINX license.
  *  P12: The base64 encoded F5XC API certificate
  *  TF_API_TOKEN: Your Terraform Cloud API token
  *  TF_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION: Your Terraform Cloud Organization
  *  TF_CLOUD_WORKSPACE_asset: Create for each asset in your workflow.  EX: TF_CLOUD_WORKSPACE_BIGIP

## Deployment

**Step 1:** Check out a branch for the workflow you wish to deploy using the following naming convention
  * xc-bigip deployment branch: deploy_xc_bigip
  * xc-nap deployment branch: deploy_xc_nap

**Step 2:** Edit xc/terraform.tfvars and add the following data
  * api_url = "Your F5XC tenant"
  * xc_namespace = "The XC namespace you are deploying to"
  * app_domain = "the FQDN of your app (cert will be autogenerated)"
  * xc_waf_blocking = "Set to true to enable blocking"

**Step 3:** Commit and push your changes to your forked repo
  * Build will run and can be monitored in the GitHub Actions tab and TF Cloud console

**Step 4:** Get outputs and access your app!
