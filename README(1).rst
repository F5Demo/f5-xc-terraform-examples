Getting Started
---------------

Prerequisites
-------------

-  `F5 Distributed Cloud Account
   (F5XC) <https://console.ves.volterra.io/signup/usage_plan>`__

   -  `F5XC API
      certificate <https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/how-to/user-mgmt/credentials>`__

-  `AWS Account <https://aws.amazon.com>`__ - Due to the assets being
   created, free tier will not work.

   -  The F5 BIG-IP AMI being used from the `AWS
      Marketplace <https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace>`__ must be
      subscribed to your account
   -  Please make sure resources like VPC and Elastic IP’s are below the
      threshold limit in that aws region

-  `Terraform Cloud
   Account <https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cloud-get-started>`__
-  `GitHub Account <https://github.com>`__

GitHub
------

-  **Fork and Clone Repo. Navigate to ``Actions`` tab and enable it.**

-  **Actions Secrets:** Create the following GitHub Actions secrets in
   your forked repo

   -  P12: The linux base64 encoded F5XC API certificate
   -  TF_API_TOKEN: Your Terraform Cloud API token
   -  TF_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION: Your Terraform Cloud Organization name
   -  TF_CLOUD_WORKSPACE\_\ *<Workspace Name>*: Create for each
      workspace in your workflow

      -  EX: TF_CLOUD_WORKSPACE_BIGIP_BASE would be created with the
         value ``bigip-base``

Workflow Runs
-------------

**STEP 1:** Check out a branch for the workflow you wish to run using
the following naming convention.

**DEPLOY**

================ =======================
Workflow         Branch Name
================ =======================
f5-xc-waf-on-k8s deploy-f5-xc-waf-on-k8s
f5-xc-waf-on-re  deploy-f5-xc-waf-on-re
================ =======================

**DESTROY**

================ ========================
Workflow         Branch Name
================ ========================
f5-xc-waf-on-k8s destroy-f5-xc-waf-on-k8s
f5-xc-waf-on-re  destroy-f5-xc-waf-on-re
================ ========================

**STEP 2:** Rename ``infra/terraform.tfvars.examples`` to
``infra/terraform.tfvars`` and add the following data: \* project_prefix
= “Your project identifier name in **lower case** letters only - this
will be applied as a prefix to all assets” \* resource_owner =
“Your-name” \* aws_region = “AWS Region” ex. us-east-1 \* azs =
[“us-east-1a”, “us-east1b”] - Change to Correct Availability Zones based
on selected Region \* Also update assets boolean value as per your
work-flow

**Step 3:** Rename ``xc/terraform.tfvars.examples`` to
``xc/terraform.tfvars`` and add the following data: \* api_url = “Your
F5XC tenant” \* xc_tenant = “Your tenant id available in F5 XC
``Administration`` section ``Tenant Overview`` menu” \* xc_namespace =
“The existing XC namespace where you want to deploy resources” \*
app_domain = “the FQDN of your app (cert will be autogenerated)” \*
xc_waf_blocking = “Set to true to enable blocking”

**STEP 4:** Commit and push your build branch to your forked repo \*
Build will run and can be monitored in the GitHub Actions tab and TF
Cloud console

| **STEP 5:** Once the pipeline completes, verify your assets were
  deployed or destroyed based on your workflow.
| **NOTE:** The autocert process takes time. It may be 5 to 10 minutes
  before Let’s Encrypt has provided the cert.
